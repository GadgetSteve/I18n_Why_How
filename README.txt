# I18n What, Why & How?

## What is I18n?

First off what is I18n? I18n is a short way of writting **Internationalisation** _(Internationalization for those who read American English)_
which you have just seen a very limited example of_. As I18n is a **lot** quicker and shorter to type _(4 characters vs. 20)_ I will continue
to write I18n rather than Internationalisation _it is also spelt the same in every version of English_. If you are wondering why it is called
I18n the answer is easy Internationalisation & Internationalization are both the letter I followed by 18 other letters and then an n.

I18n is the practice of making your software usable by people for whom English is not the first language, (some users may no have any English),
ideally without having to have a different version of your application _(and its source code)_ for each supported language.
