# I18n What, Why & How?

## What is I18n?

First off what is I18n? I18n is a short way of writting **Internationalisation** _(Internationalization for those who read American English)_
which you have just seen a very limited example of_. As I18n is a **lot** quicker and shorter to type _(4 characters vs. 20)_ I will continue
to write I18n rather than Internationalisation _it is also spelt the same in every version of English_. If you are wondering why it is called
I18n the answer is easy Internationalisation & Internationalization are both the letter I followed by 18 other letters and then an n.

I18n is the practice of making your software usable by people for whom English is not the first language, (some users may no have any English),
ideally without having to have a different version of your application _(and its source code)_ for each supported language.

## Why Internationalise?

The first, _and possibly most important to many companies,_ reason to consider applying I18n to your applications is the number of users that it
will make your application available & accessible to. Yes English _in one variant or another_, *is* currently the most widely used language without
_according to [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/) 25th Edition 2022_ the single most widely used language with a total of 1.452 billion 
people listing it as their first or second language - _however only 372.9 million listed it as their *first* language_. In 2020 the CIA estimated 
that only 16.5% of the world population spoke English. This means that if your application is only available in English then it is only available
to that percentage of the world. You _or your company_ are missing out on 83.5% of the world. Of course not all of the people who don't speak English
have access to, or can use, a computer, smartphone or other device but it is also safe to say that not everybody who does use such a device knows
any English _or much English_.

A second reason to consider is that, when communicating with someone in a language that is not their first language_, errors and misunderstandings 
are common and comprihension times go up - so if you have an important or urgent message to communicate it is obviously better to use the first
language of the person that you are comunicating with. Of course if your application has safety implications this is especially important but even
if it doesn't the extra expence, and user frustrations, caused by misunderstandings can be costly to both you and your users.

Of course another factor to consider is that customers purchasing software will, naturally, usually prefer to purchase software that is in the end
users first language if for no other reason than familiarity.

There are even moves by some legislatures to either promote the availability & use of _or restrict the selection of_ software that uses specific 
languages.
